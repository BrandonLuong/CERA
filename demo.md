# Demo of SDG&E's Perspective
Using the customer inputs we display the results to an expert with a topic classification, sentiment, and confidence in equipment detection as seen in the Streamlit demo. The expert can view the image with the confidence score of the image containing equipment plus the sentiment that conveys the urgency of the situation. We plan on making a formula to calculate the urgency with the current evaluations.
 <!-- but as we see it now, the formula and ranking of urgency would be convoluted from our inexperience with understanding the risk factors. -->
