# Demo of SDG&E's Perspective
With the modelâ€™s and the user inputs we present the SDG&E domain expert with a topic, sentiment and urgency as seen in the Streamlit demo. The expert can view the image with the confidence score of the image containing equipment plus the sentiment that conveys the urgency of the situation. We plan on making a formula to calculate the urgency with the current evaluations.
 <!-- but as we see it now, the formula and ranking of urgency would be convoluted from our inexperience with understanding the risk factors. -->
