<p>We aquired photos of poles around San Diego in different times of day and different angles manually as a team. To replicate the abilities of the average person, the photos are intentionally imperfect to give the data more realistic features. The text dataset was taken from a project named <a href="https://crisisnlp.qcri.org/humaid_dataset">â€˜HumAIDâ€™</a> that collected tweets made during natural disasters. It was chosen because they were short and we expect reports from customers no longer than around a paragraph. Additionally the data included topics that should be related to forms of damage done to poles.</p>
